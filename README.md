There are other endpoints if needed in the future.


## To get going
Install all relevant dependencies (npm i)
### `npm start`


### Why react?

After spiking Swift UI, I was more confident to show my skillset using React. React Native was a runner up for frontend, however React is more efficient and with a mobile phone first approach, it is accessible for those using mobile devices and web.
